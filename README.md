# Retailer Ecommerce

Problem: Bing Bing’s mom is operating a small business for selling windows, glasses, and doors. The procedure is repetitive with lots of useless paperwork. Thus, we want to help and reduce the procedure.

The original procedure
1. Receive order from customer
2. Give quote to customer
3. Customer pays the deposit
4. Copy the order and send it to factory  (there are different factories that can choose from)
5. Receive quote from the factory
6. Confirm and send back the quote to the factory
7. Factory places the order and gives back a delivery date
8. Send the estimated delivery date to customer
9. Receive products from factory
10. Call customer to pick up or deliver the product  to customer
11. Count the profit by using a calculator

Solution: Create a retailer ecommerce website. In this website, we expect to have two kinds of users,  customer and employee. We also expect to have two different methods to handle orders as we can have customer-initiated order and employee-initiated order.

Customer-initiated order procedure
1. Create an account (if doesn’t have one)
1.1 Need to reference or confirm by the company to prevent competitors
2. Place an order by giving specifications of product
3. Confirm the order, pay a 25% deposit, and ask for signature
4. Send the order to the company
4.1 They can see the company's action in real time (live user interaction)
5. Employee sends the order to the factory
6. Confirm the factory’s quote (algorithm or machine learning)
7. Employee updates the delivery date once received from the factory
4-7. Can become automatic if we have the technical skills (god provides).

Employee-initiated order procedure
1. Enter the specifications of product given by customers 
2. Confirm with customer, collect at least 10%  deposit, and ask for signature
3. Submit and send the order to the factory
4. Confirm quote and update the delivery date
